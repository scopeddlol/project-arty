## Interfaces

The project ships two interfaces from the same repository and GitHub Pages deployment:

- **Desktop** — `/`
- **Mobile** — `/mobile/`

Phones are automatically routed from the desktop entry pages to the matching mobile route. The mobile UI is a separate map-first interface with touch panning, pinch zoom, touch-friendly point placement, Map Tools, and a bottom-sheet calculator.

Both interfaces reuse the same calculator logic, maps, tile pyramid, configuration, translations, saved targets, drawings, browser storage, and optional live team lobbies.

## Live Team Lobbies

Create a lobby and share its invite link or code to plan on the same tactical map. Drawings, zones, polygons, and user markers synchronise live. Every player keeps a separate weapon, artillery point, target, and range circle; teammates see labelled player positions without duplicate range circles.

Lobby traffic starts only after a player creates or joins a room. See [Collaborative lobbies](docs/lobbies.md) for deployment, privacy, recovery, limits, and Cloudflare configuration.

## Localization

The shared locale system supports English, Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Czech, and the non-indexed Cat locale.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is split into focused files to keep this README concise.

- [Features & weapons](docs/features.md) — calculator features, Map Tools, weapons, touch controls, and coordinate system
- [Maps](docs/maps.md) — map configuration, tile structure, bounds, marker zoom visibility, and adding new maps
- [Mobile interface](docs/mobile.md) — mobile routes, automatic routing, touch controls, and deployment architecture
- [Localization](docs/localization.md) — supported languages, shared translations, automatic language selection, localized URLs, and SEO metadata
- [Development](docs/development.md) — project structure, local development, unified build process, and GitHub Pages deployment
- [Analytics](docs/analytics.md) — Umami custom events, event payloads, debouncing, and privacy considerations
- [Message of the Day](docs/motd.md) — MOTD configuration, localization, and behavior
- [Collaborative lobbies](docs/lobbies.md) — live team map behaviour, Cloudflare deployment, limits, privacy, and recovery
- [Security hardening](docs/security.md) — public-source threat model, Cloudflare headers, secrets, CI, and residual risks

## Self-Hosting

Run your own copy with Docker Compose:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scopeddlol/wardogs-arty-calculator/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/`. Map tiles are proxied and cached by the container, so it works on any hostname or LAN address. Lobbies and analytics are disabled in self-hosted builds. See [Self-hosting with Docker](docs/self-hosting.md) for configuration, updates and HTTPS.

## Quick Start (development)

```bash
npm run build
cd dist
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
Desktop:            http://localhost:8000/
Mobile:             http://localhost:8000/mobile/
```
