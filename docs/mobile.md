# Mobile Interface

The mobile interface is a separate map-first UI built from the same repository as the desktop application.

It is served by the same container as the desktop interface:

```text
http://<your-host>:8080/mobile/
```

There is no separate subdomain, repository, tile set, locale set, or deployment.

## Architecture

Desktop and mobile use different page shells but share the same application code and data:

```text
Desktop UI                  Mobile UI
/                           /mobile/
        \                   /
         \                 /
          shared JS / data
          shared locales
          shared maps/tiles
          shared config
          shared localStorage
```

This means map calibration, weapon data, marker changes, translations, saved targets, drawings, theme, and other stored preferences do not need separate mobile copies.

## Routes

Desktop routes:

```text
/
/ru/
/uk/
/de/
/fr/
/es/
/pl/
/pt/
/zh-cn/
/ko/
/ja/
/cat/
```

Mobile routes:

```text
/mobile/
/mobile/ru/
/mobile/uk/
/mobile/de/
/mobile/fr/
/mobile/es/
/mobile/pl/
/mobile/pt/
/mobile/zh-cn/
/mobile/ko/
/mobile/ja/
/mobile/cat/
```

Normal mobile locale pages use the matching desktop locale as their canonical URL. The Cat localization remains excluded from normal search indexing.

## Automatic Mobile Routing

Desktop entry pages load `js/core/mobile-redirect.js` before the main application.

A device is routed to `/mobile/` when either:

- `navigator.userAgentData.mobile` reports a mobile device, or
- the primary pointer is coarse and the viewport is at most 900 CSS pixels wide.

The current explicit language route is preserved:

```text
/<locale>/ -> /mobile/<locale>/
```

Query parameters and the URL hash are also preserved.

A browser locale matching an entry in `locales/index.json` can select the corresponding language automatically when no manual language preference has already been saved.

### Requesting the desktop UI on a phone

The mobile interface contains a **Desktop version** link. It opens the matching desktop language route with:

```text
?desktop=1
```

The desktop routing script stores that override in `sessionStorage`, so automatic mobile routing stays disabled for the current browser tab/session rather than permanently changing the user's preference.

Opening the mobile route explicitly restores automatic routing for future desktop visits.

## Touch Controls

- **Tap** an empty map position to place the currently selected Artillery/Target point.
- **Drag** an existing Artillery/Target point to reposition it.
- **Drag with one finger** on empty map space to pan.
- **Pinch with two fingers** to zoom around the gesture midpoint and pan naturally with the gesture.
- **Ruler**, **Pencil**, **Zone**, **Polygon**, and **Eraser** use direct one-finger interaction while active. Drag from a center point to draw a zone. Tap polygon vertices and tap the first vertex again to finish. Eraser can remove strokes, zones, polygons, and user-placed map markers.
- Preset map markers can be tapped and selected as the current target.
- **Layers** opens to the left of the vertical tool bar so the full list has enough usable height on phones. It includes a toggle for cursor-coordinate visibility and touch-accessible Undo / Redo controls.
- **Import / Export** is available as a touch-friendly Map Tool for backing up or sharing drawings, zones, polygons, user markers, and layer settings.
- The fullscreen Map Tool is desktop-only and is intentionally hidden on mobile browsers.
- The calculator/settings area is a swipeable bottom sheet.

The map canvas uses Pointer Events and disables native touch gestures on the canvas so browser scrolling and page zoom do not interfere with map interaction.

## Local Development

Run the development server (see [Development](development.md)) or the container
(see [Self-hosting](self-hosting.md)) and open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/mobile/
http://localhost:8000/mobile/<locale>/
```

Generated desktop/mobile locale routes are production-build outputs, so use `npm run build` when validating locale routing and SEO metadata.

Useful test viewports include:

```text
360x640
390x844
430x932
844x390
932x430
768x1024
```

Mobile QA for every supported locale should include at least one narrow-phone viewport. Check long labels, the language selector, the bottom sheet and Map Tools for overflow.

## Deployment

The mobile interface requires no separate hosting configuration. `npm run build`
produces desktop and mobile entry pages in the single `dist/` directory, which
the Docker image serves as-is.

## Saved target transfer

The mobile Saved Targets panel supports exporting a single target, exporting the full target list, and importing either format. Imported targets are merged into the existing list and receive new internal IDs to avoid collisions.

## Compact Map Tools menu

On mobile, Map Tools are collapsed behind a single floating button by default. Tapping it expands the vertical tool list; tapping it again collapses the list and closes any open Map Tool popover. This keeps the map clear on small phone screens while preserving the full touch toolset.

### Coordinate sharing

The mobile point controls include compact Copy and Paste actions for both Artillery and Target. Paste accepts the same shareable coordinate format as desktop and falls back to a manual paste prompt when the mobile browser does not expose clipboard read access.

### Artillery / Target locks

Each point has a compact Lock action. Locking a point prevents touch taps and dragging from changing it on the map; the corresponding map mode shows a lock indicator. Manual X/Y entry and coordinate Paste still work while locked.

### Firing-solution HUD

The map HUD prioritizes Distance, MIL, and Azimuth equally in a compact three-column solution panel. Range status remains visible below the primary values, while ΔX/ΔY stay in the expanded Result sheet as secondary details.

The SPH-2 leveling warning uses the shared localization system and remains informational only. Terrain3D elevation context does not automatically change MIL in this release.
