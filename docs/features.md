### Map Tools

The floating Map Tools toolbar provides:

- **Ruler** — measure distance and azimuth
- **Pencil** — draw directly on the map
- **Zone** — drag from the center to create a circular zone
- **Polygon** — click vertices, then click the first vertex, double-click, or press `Enter` to finish
- **Eraser** — remove pencil strokes, zones, polygons, and user-placed map markers
- **Markers** — place tactical markers
- **Coordinate Search** — jump to specific coordinates
- **Adjust Fire** — arrow pad that stages Add/Drop and Left/Right corrections in meters, or mark/paste the observed impact point to shift the target by the observed miss
- **Layers** — toggle map tiles, overlays, drawings, markers, and cursor coordinates
- **Import / Export** — back up or share drawings, zones, polygons, user markers, and layer visibility settings as JSON
- **Undo / Redo** — drawings, zones, polygons, erased items, user markers, and Artillery/Target position changes

Outside a lobby, drawings, zones, polygons, and user markers are stored locally per map and are shared between desktop and mobile because both interfaces use the same site origin. Inside a lobby, those tactical objects synchronise with the room instead. The Import / Export Map Tool exports the complete persistent Map Tools state across maps, including layer visibility. Imports are merged with existing user content and imported item IDs are regenerated to avoid collisions.

### Live Team Lobbies

- Create a room and invite teammates with a link or code
- Synchronise drawings, zones, polygons, and user-placed tactical markers
- Optionally include the creator's saved targets when creating the room
- Keep the selected weapon, artillery point, active target, and range circle separate for every player
- Show teammates as labelled artillery-to-target overlays without their range circles
- Keep camera position, zoom, active tool, layers, point locks, theme, and language local

Lobbies need the upstream project's Cloudflare lobby service, which only accepts the official site. They are therefore **disabled** in PROJECT: ARTY (`collab.enabled` in `config/app.json`), and the lobby menu is hidden.

### Mobile Interface

The dedicated `/mobile/` UI is designed around touch input rather than being a scaled-down desktop layout.

- One-finger map panning
- Two-finger pinch zoom around the gesture midpoint
- Tap-to-place Artillery/Target
- Drag-to-move Artillery/Target
- Touch Map Tools, including Pencil, Zone, Polygon, Eraser, Markers, Layers, and Import / Export; the mobile toolbar is collapsed behind a single button by default
- Touch-accessible Undo / Redo buttons inside Layers
- Tap preset marker to select it as Target
- Swipeable bottom sheet for calculator, map settings, and saved targets
- Automatic routing from narrow coarse-pointer devices
- Desktop-version escape link

See [Mobile Interface](mobile.md) for routing and deployment details.

### Default Shortcuts

Desktop Map Tool shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `1` | Select Artillery placement |
| `2` | Select Target placement |
| `R` | Ruler |
| `P` | Pencil |
| `Z` | Zone |
| `G` | Polygon |
| `E` | Eraser |
| `M` | Markers |
| `F` | Coordinate Search |
| `I` | Adjust Fire |
| `L` | Layers |
| `Esc` | Leave active tool |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl + Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo |

Letter shortcuts use physical keyboard positions, so they keep working when the active input language changes (for example, between English and Russian layouts).

Desktop camera controls:

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Pan the map |
| Arrow keys | Pan the map |
| `Shift` + pan | Pan faster |
| `+` | Zoom in |
| `-` | Zoom out |
| Right-click drag | Pan the map |
| `Ctrl` + left-click drag | Pan the map |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom at the cursor |

Map Tool shortcuts and the keyboard pan speed can be configured in:

```text
config/app.json
```

## Supported Weapons

Weapon definitions are stored separately from the application logic:

```text
data/weapons.json
```

This allows weapons and their properties to be updated without modifying the core JavaScript.

Current weapon support includes:

| Weapon | Range |
|---|---:|
| L81 Mortar | 132–684 m |
| SPH-2 | 780–2629 m |

---

## Coordinate System

Physical distance conversion is map-specific and is configured by `coordinateMetersPerUnit`.

For the calibrated Bakurani map:

```text
1.00 coordinate = 100 m
0.10 coordinate = 10 m
0.01 coordinate = 1 m
```

For example, the distance between:

```text
X105.00 Y115.10
X105.10 Y115.10
```

is 10 meters.

Azimuth follows standard compass bearings:

```text
0°   = North
90°  = East
180° = South
270° = West
```


## MIL firing solutions

The result panel calculates elevation in MIL from the configured ballistic tables. L81 Mortar uses a single firing solution. SPH-2 exposes low-angle and high-angle solutions when both trajectories are available for the current distance. Weapon range limits remain separate from ballistic-table coverage, so samples outside the configured playable range are not treated as valid shots.


## Terrain elevation and SPH-2 setup

Bakurani can provide terrain height at the Artillery and Target coordinates. When both samples are available, the SPH-2 result context shows:

```text
ΔZ = target elevation - artillery elevation
```

A positive value means the target is above the artillery position. A negative value means the target is below it.

Terrain elevation remains informational by default. The optional Terrain3D correction is off by default and changes an arc only after the verified resolver returns `SAFE_CONSENSUS`; every other state keeps the firing-table value.

The separate SPH-2 hull-heading experiment is controlled by `features.sphPlatformCorrection.enabled` in `config/app.json`. When enabled, it does not alter MIL until the user enters a hull direction. Until that opt-in, the normal low- and high-angle solutions remain visible.

SPH-2 accuracy is also affected by vehicle attitude. A visible warning is shown under the result when SPH-2 is selected. In the gunner HUD, the two small side markers around the vehicle silhouette below `STABILIZED / ASL` indicate lateral tilt. For best accuracy, reposition the vehicle until those markers are as centered and aligned as possible and avoid parking on an obvious uphill/downhill slope.

See [Terrain Elevation & SPH-2 Setup](terrain.md) for data layout, runtime behavior, fallback rules, and validation details.


## Coordinate copy / paste

Artillery and Target positions can be copied in the shareable `x100.05, y109.14` format and pasted back with one action. The parser accepts labeled X/Y values, plain two-number input, decimal points, and decimal commas. Clipboard APIs are used when available, with a manual prompt fallback when browser permissions prevent direct clipboard access.


## Position locks

Artillery and Target can be locked independently against direct map interaction. A locked point cannot be moved by map clicks, marker dragging, touch dragging, or preset-marker target selection. Manual coordinate input and the coordinate Paste action remain available while a point is locked, so the lock acts as protection against accidental map edits rather than disabling intentional coordinate entry. Explicit actions such as Swap, Reset, and restoring a saved target are also left available.


## Firing-solution result hierarchy

Distance, MIL, and azimuth are treated as the three primary firing-solution values and are shown together in a high-contrast metric grid. Distance keeps meters as the primary value and kilometers as secondary context; MIL shows trajectory labels only as secondary information; ΔX and ΔY are visually de-emphasized below the main solution.
